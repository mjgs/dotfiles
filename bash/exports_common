# File: bash/exports_common
# Role: Environment variables common to all platforms (macOS & Android).
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- 1. General Configuration ---

# Set your preferred editor for Git, terminal programs, and the 'dotedit' function.
# This ensures 'nvim' is used everywhere.
export EDITOR='nvim'

# Set your default pager (what views long output, e.g., 'man' pages).
export PAGER='less'

# Set your preferred text terminal type for better color and compatibility.
export TERM='xterm-256color'

# --- 2. Shell History and Behavior ---

# Increase the size of the history list in memory and on disk.
export HISTSIZE=100000
export HISTFILESIZE=50000

# Set history to ignore duplicate lines and commands that start with a space.
export HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth

# Append to the history file rather than overwriting it.
shopt -s histappend

# --- 3. Custom Paths (Based on Your Setup) ---

# Define the local path for user-installed binaries.
# This ensures local tools and npm global installs are found first.
# NOTE: macOS uses $HOME/bin and Termux uses $HOME/bin. This works across both.
export PATH="${HOME}/bin:${PATH}"

# Add any language-specific environment variables you always need.
# Example: Rust and Go paths are commonly included here.
# export PATH="${HOME}/.cargo/bin:${PATH}"
# export PATH="/usr/local/go/bin:${PATH}" # MacPorts/Homebrew handles this for you usually

# --- 4. Language & Locale (Optional) ---

# Set to suppress locale warnings and ensure UTF-8 is used.
export LANG='en_US.UTF-8'
export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'

# --- 5. Directory Variables ---

export POSTS_DIR=$HOME/posts
export WEBSITE_DIR=$HOME/website
export TEMPLATES_DIR=$HOME/templates
